# Symbol Explorer

The symbol explorer is an alternative way to view and access markets. It contains the full list of available markets grouped by trading venue. To open the symbol explorer, search for `Symbol Explorer` in the [omnibar](/terminal/omnibar) and press `Enter`. You can also find the symbol explorer component under the `View > Components` menu.

You can open market data components directly from the symbol explorer. Double clicking a row in the explorer will open up a standard chart. Alternatively, you can right click a market in the explorer to open other components, such as the orderbook or trade history.

## Linking the Symbol Explorer

The symbol explorer may be linked to other tabs to quickly switch market data views. To change the group's market, simply click a row in the symbol explorer. You can learn more about linking tabs in the [associated document](/terminal/linking-tabs).
