# Keymaps

Traders require speed and accuracy. Keyboard shortcuts are an important tool for any trading system. Via has very powerful keymapping capabilities, and offers hundreds of bindings straight out of the box. You are also able to change these default keybindings by altering your keymaps file, which will be documented at a later time. If you wish to have this level of customization right now, please reach out to us through our [Slack](https://slack.via.world/) or [Telegram](https://t.me/viaplatform) channels, and we can assist you directly.

Keybindings can include a single key, a combination of keys, or a sequential series of key strokes.

Here is a list of common commands:

| Key(s) | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `Ctrl+N` or `Cmd+N` | Open a new Via window. |
| `Ctrl+S` or `Cmd+S` | Save the current workspace. |
| `Ctrl+K` or `Cmd+K` | Switch your current workspace. |
| `Ctrl+W` or `Cmd+W` | Close the currently focused component. |
| `Ctrl+F` or `Cmd+F` | Focus the omnibar. |
| `Esc` | Unfocus the omnibar or currently selected item. |
| `Up` and `Down` | Navigate through options. |
| `Enter` or `Return` | Confirm the selected option. |

## Removing Keybindings For a Single Component

Keybindings can be disabled on a component-by-component basis. While most components only contain keymaps for their own actions, sometimes these may conflict with other ones that you have already set. In this case, you may wish to simply disable all keybindings for a particular component.

To remove keybindings for a single component:

1. First navigate to the settings screen by pressing `Ctrl+,` or `Cmd+,`. Alternatively, you can access the settings panel by searching for it in the omnibar.
2. Click on the `Manage Packages` tab at the top of the settings panel.
3. Find the package for which you wish to disable keybindings and click on `Settings` towards the right side of the package's row.
4. Scroll down until you see a section called `Keybindings`. If there is no such section, then this package does not have any of its own keybindings.
5. Uncheck the box entitled `Enable`.
