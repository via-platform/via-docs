# Chart Trading

Via allows you to place and cancel orders directly from the chart. Pending and open orders will appear as a box on any charts that are displaying the corresponding market. Order boxes are removed from the chart when an order has been filled or canceled. This process happens automatically as you use the application.

## Modifying and Transmitting Orders

When you are in the process of creating a new order (e.g. through the [trade window](/terminal/executing-trades)), a pending order box will appear on any corresponding charts. The boxes will only appear if:

* The order is for the same market that the chart is displaying, and
* The order is valid (i.e. it contains all of the necessary fields)

Before transmitting an order, the order box on a chart can be dragged up and down to modify the limit price. You will also notice that the order will change price in the trade window, as well as on any other charts open to the same market. To cancel a trade prior to submission, you can click the cancel icon towards the right side of the box.

## Canceling Orders

To cancel an open order from the chart, click the cancel icon towards the right side of the order box. You will be prompted to confirm order cancellation, after which your request will be sent to the exchange.
