# Market Watchlist

Via has an advanced market watchlist to help you stay on top of price action even when you're not watching a particular chart. You can organize your watchlist for readability, or create more than one watchlist, depending on your needs.

## Creating a Watchlist

To create a new watchlist, search for the `Watchlist` component in the [omnibar](/terminal/omnibar) and press `Enter`. You can also find the watchlist component under the `View > Components` menu. Once your watchlist is open, you can add markets to any available row.

To add a market to your watchlist, double click the desired row, and search for the market in the omnibar.

## Inserting and Removing Rows

To insert a new blank row into the table, right click in the desired location and select either `Insert Row Above` or `Insert Row Below`. To delete a row, or clear a market from a row, right click the desired row and select `Clear Market` or `Delete Row`.

## Accessing Market data

You can quickly access market data from the watchlist by right clicking the desired row. You can open up a new chart, view the orderbook, view trade history data or create a depth chart from the right click menu.

## Modifying Columns

You may wish to modify the data that is displayed. To modify which columns you see, right click the column headers.
