# Reporting Issues and Making Suggestions

If you think you've discovered a bug in Via, you're probably right. Head over to our [GitHub issues](https://github.com/via-platform/via/issues) page to report it. Same goes for feature improvements or suggestions. Please take a moment to do a write up of your issue or suggestion so we have something to work with and don't have to spend time figuring out what you mean. In addition, please tag your issue with the appropriate GitHub label so we know whether it's a feature or a suggestion. We don't know everything, and we're happy to have our users suggest things for us to work on. User feedback is an extremely important part of our product development roadmap.

We also welcome pull requests to any of our open source packages.

If you don't have a GitHub account, or would rather tell us in person, feel free to reach out through our [Slack](https://slack.via.world/) or [Telegram](https://t.me/viaplatform) channels.
