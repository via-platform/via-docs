# Setting a Phone Number

Via does not require that you add a phone number to your account, however you may wish to set one in order to receive real time SMS notifications in the event that one of your alerts is triggered.

To add a phone number to your account, head to the [account page on the Via website](https://via.world/account) and log in. You will need to enter your 2-factor authentication code if you have one set on your account. From the account page, select the option to set your phone number.

After you enter your phone number in the form, Via will send you a test notification containing a confirmation code. This is to prevent you from setting up a number that does not belong to you. The confirmation code may take a few moments to arrive. If it does not arrive after one minute, please try again by reloading the page and ensure that the number you entered was correct. Once you enter the confirmation code successfully, your phone number is ready to start receiving SMS notifications.

You can enable SMS notifications for a specific alert by checking the box under `Advanced Options` on the alert creation component. Alternatively, you can enable SMS notifications for all alerts by modifying the option on the Alerts package settings page in the `Settings` component.
