# Trade History

The trade history component contains a real time data feed of order executions for a given market. To open a trade history component, search for `Trade History` in the [omnibar](/terminal/omnibar) and press `Enter`. You can also find the trade history component under the `View > Components` menu.

To switch markets, click the market name in the top left corner. The component currently shows the most recent 100 trades executed in a given market and will update in real time as matches occur.

## Linking the Trade History Component

The trade history component may be linked to other tabs to quickly switch market data views. You can learn more about linking tabs in the [associated document](/terminal/linking-tabs).
