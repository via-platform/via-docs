# Linking Tabs

Often, you want components to work together in conjunction with one another. For example, you may want to keep a chart and orderbook synced to the same market. This is easy to achieve in Via. To link tabs into a single group, click the dot in the top left corner of a tab. You will have the option to select a color group from a dropdown menu. Tabs that are a part of the same color group may have shared functionality. Please keep in mind that specific shared functionality may vary by component, and some components cannot be grouped at all.
