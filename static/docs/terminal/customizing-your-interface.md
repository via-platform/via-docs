# Customizing Your Interface

The Via Terminal interface is allows for very powerful customization to suit your trading style and preferences. Since Via is a desktop application, it supports multiple windows across multiple monitors.

When your first open Via, you will be greeted by the welcome screen, which displays basic information about the application. This screen can be disabled in the future by un-checking `Show this page on startup` in the bottom-center of the pane.
