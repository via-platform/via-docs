# The Omnibar

The omnibar is designed to be a central point of control for the user. It is located at the top of every workspace and can be utilized in three major ways:

1. You can use the omnibar to arbitrarily search for markets, components, or commands.
2. Individual components use the omnibar for scoped selections.

The first case is self explanatory. The second case is something that you'll notice as you continue to use Via. When a component needs you to select an option from a long list, it will often use the functionality of the omnibar to display your choices. For example, when you are trying to add an indicator to your chart, the Chart components has you choose from a list of indicators that are displayed in the omnibar.

This way, you are able to use the full functionality of the omnibar, which includes smart filtering, full text descriptions, and numerous hotkeys to quickly find what you are looking for. If the omnibar is "scoped" to a specific component, the word "Via" will change to the scoped action, as in the screenshot below ("Add Chart Indicator").

If the omnibar has no results to diplay, it will turn red.

## Omnibar Hotkeys

By default, the omnibar is mapped with the following hotkeys:

| Key(s) | Description |

| `Ctrl+F` or `Cmd+F` | Focus the omnibar. |
| `Esc` | Unfocus the omnibar and cancel your search query. |
| `Up` and `Down` | Navigate through the search results. |
| `Enter` or `Return` | Confirm the selected result. |
