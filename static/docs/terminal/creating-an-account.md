# Creating a Via Account

In order to use Via Terminal, you must create an account. All you need to create an account is a personal email address. There are a few reasons that we require you to create an account:

* It is the easiest way to identify you if you use Via across multiple devices.
* Your account is tied to your subscription status.
* We store your saved workspaces (and similar data) on our servers.
* We may need to contact you in important situations, such as a change of license status or a critical bug fix.
* You can enable email and text alerts that require information tied to your account.

**We will not send you spam messages or sell / share your email address with anyone else.**

## Create Your Account

To create an account, open up the Via application and select `Sign Up`.

Enter a valid email address, create a password, and click `Create Account`. While there are no specific rules for passwords, please use best practices to keep your account safe. Although there is no personal information (other than your email address) stored on our servers, poor account security can be dangerous if your physical device is stolen.

## Confirm Your Email Address

Before you begin using Via, please confirm your email address by clicking on the link sent to your inbox. If your email address is not confirmed within 24 hours of signing up, your account will be locked. You may continue with the signup process before confirming your email, but don't forget to do it later!

## Setting Up Two-Factor Authentication

To set up two-factor authentication (2FA) please [read the guide here](/docs/terminal/two-factor-authentication). If you wish to skip this process and begin using Via right away, simply skip it by clicking on the option towards the bottom of the screen.
