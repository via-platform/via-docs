## Which section is right for me?

Thanks for downloading the Via cryptocurrency trading platform by Via Systems. We've put a lot of thought and effort into building a platform to best suit the needs of professional cryptocurrency traders. Hopefully, Via will improve your trading strategies, processes, and execution, to make you a better and more profitable trader.

These guides will give you a basic overview of the tools you need to get started analyzing and trading the crypto markets with Via. The platform is extensive and can be a lot to take in, but after a few minutes, you should find it extremely intuitive, especially compared to many of the traditional financial trading platforms on the market.

Via is still in its infancy. Features are constantly being added and changed, releases are frequent, and as a result, you may encounter some issues with the software.
